#### Store for Car Parts

A company is planning to create a system for managing a store for auto parts. A single part can be used for different car models and it has following characteristics: code, name, category (e.g. suspension, tires and wheels, engine, accessories and etc.), purchase price, sale price, list of car models, with which it is compatible (each car is described with brand, model and year of manufacture, e. g. Mercedes C320, 2008) and manufacturing company. Manufacturing companies are described with name, country, address, phone and fax.

Design a set of classes with relationships between them, which model the data for the store. Write a demonstration program, which demonstrates the classes and their all functionality work correctly with some sample data.
