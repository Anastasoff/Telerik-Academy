1. What database models do you know?
- Hierarchical database model
- Network model
- Relational model
- Entity–relationship model
- Object model
- Document model
- Entity–attribute–value model
- Star schema

2. Which are the main functions performed by a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)?
- Relational Database Management System manage data stored in tables.

3. Define what is "table" in database terms.
- Table contains data which is arranged in rows and columns.

4. Explain the difference between a primary and a foreign key.
- Primary key is a column in a table that uniquely identifies its rows. There are composite primary keys, which are compose be several columns.
- Foreign key is an identifier of a record located in another table.
- We use primary and foreign keys to have relations between different tables.

5. Explain the different kinds of relationships between tables in relational databases.
- There are 3 kinds of relations in relational databases:
	One-to-many
	Many-to-many
	One-to-one

6. When is a certain database schema normalized? What are the advantages of normalized databases?
- Normalized schema is when we do not have repeating data.

7. What are database integrity constraints and when are they used?
- Integrity constraint - Ensures data integrity in the database tables
- Primary key constraint - Ensures that the primary key of a table has unique value for each table row
- Unique key constraint - Ensures that all values in a certain column are unique

8. Point out the pros and cons of using indexes in a database.
Pros:
	- Fast searching of values in a certain column or group of columns
Cons:
	- Slow adding and deleting of records

9. What's the main purpose of the SQL language?
- Purpose of SQL Structured Query Language is to provide a Structured way by which one can Query information in database using a standard Language.

10. What are transactions used for? Give an example.
- Transactions are used to guarantee the consistency and the integrity of the database

11. What is a NoSQL database?
- A NoSQL or Not Only SQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Motivations for this approach include simplicity of design, horizontal scaling and finer control over availability.

12. Explain the classical non-relational data models.
- Document model
	Set of documents, e.g. JSON strings
- Key-value model
	Set of key-value pairs
- Hierarchical key-value model
	Hierarchical key-value pairs
- Wide-column model
	Key-value model with schema
- Object model
	Set of OOP-style objects
	
13. Give few examples of NoSQL databases and their pros and cons.
- Redis
- MongoDB
- CouchDB
- Cassandra
